You're about to create a minimal dependency injection container.

We'll use a structure inspired by the DI container in Angular.JS.

## How to use this repository?

### Structure

The repo has 3 important files:

 * **di.js** will contain your source code
 * **spec.js** contains for each step a series of specs that your code must fulfill
 * **index.html** can be opened in the browser and will display the results of the spec run

### Branches

This repository contains a number of branches:

 * step_1
 * step_2
 * ...

For each of the steps of the workshop.

## Step 0

You are currently on the master branch, you need to switch to the `step_1` branch.

```sh
git checkout step_1
```
